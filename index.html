  <h1>Tutorial for R-exams package</h1>
  <p>R-exams is an R package that allows educators to create randomized exams and quizzes. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a simple quiz using R-exams.

Installation
First, you need to install the R-exams package. You can do this by running the following command in R:

r
Copy code
install.packages("exams")
Creating a Simple Quiz
Let's create a simple quiz that includes two multiple-choice questions. Here's the code for the first question:

r
Copy code
mc1 <- list(
  question = "What is the capital of France?",
  correct = "Paris",
  wrong = c("London", "Berlin", "Rome")
)
This creates a list that specifies the question, the correct answer, and three incorrect answers. Note that the correct answer should always be listed first.

Here's the code for the second question:

r
Copy code
mc2 <- list(
  question = "What is the largest planet in our solar system?",
  correct = "Jupiter",
  wrong = c("Mars", "Venus", "Saturn")
)
Again, this creates a list that specifies the question, the correct answer, and three incorrect answers.

Now we can combine these questions into a simple quiz:

r
Copy code
quiz <- list(mc1, mc2)
Generating the Quiz
To generate the quiz, we can use the exams2html() function:

r
Copy code
exams2html(quiz, file = "myquiz.html")
This will create an HTML file called myquiz.html that includes the quiz.

If you want to generate a PDF version of the quiz, you can use the exams2pdf() function:

r
Copy code
exams2pdf(quiz, file = "myquiz.pdf")
This will create a PDF file called myquiz.pdf that includes the quiz.

Conclusion
That's it! You've just created a simple quiz using R-exams. Of course, this is just the beginning - R-exams supports many more question types and options, including true/false questions, open-ended questions, and more complex exercises. With R-exams, you have the flexibility to create assessments that test a wide range of knowledge and skills, and the ability to generate multiple versions of an exam to ensure fairness and minimize cheating.</p>
